# COBOL Snippets

My collection of COBOL source code collected along my journey into the language.

Despite being an old language with a bad reputation, I kind of like COBOL. It has a
very pleasing structure and carries a lot of historic significance. One day I would
like to run code on an actual mainframe! ðŸ¤“

## A note on binaries

I am using GNU COBOL and the `cobc` compiler on a M1 Mac Mini using macOS. Unless
you have the same setup, the binaries in `bin/` won't work. ðŸ˜‹

## A note on the source

Given that I am new to COBOL programming, most of this source code is not invented by
myself. It is based on the code from Beginning COBOL for Programmers by Michael 
Coughlan, but I adjusted it so it feels more like "my code".
